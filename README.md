### Election-Analysis
## Hello, my name is Briza Tayagua-Delgado!

# **Research Question**: What environmental factors affect how Latinos voted in the 2020 election?

### I investigated this by looking at four different states with high Latino Populations in census data. These four states are: Texas, California, Florida, and New York.

### These four states are the four states with the highest Latino populations in the US.

### We also know that the Latino population makes up a significant portion of the total population because of how it compares to the average populations of white people in each county. This makes sense since porportionally California and Texas are larger states.

### Latinos made up 13.6% of the voters for the 2020 election, making their impact significant.

### Two of these states had a republican result in the 2020 election while the other two had a democrat result in the 2020 election. So, what environmental factors affect how Latinos vote and in turn affect the result of the elections? 

# Environmental Factor One: Income Per Capita
### What is income per capita? 
### Income per capita is a way of measuring the average income per person in a given nation. 

![Average Income Per Capita Per County](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a80bff44-9e6c-4fbf-a00b-c43d3c269a1b)

### We can see that in Texas and Florida have similar average income's that are lower to the average incomes in New York and California. This could be an environmental factor that affects how Latinos vote in respective states. Although this is possible, it is important to note that this could also be due to the fact that California and New York have higher cost of living than Florida and Texas. 

### According to insure.com/cost-of-living-by-state.html, California had an average cost of living index of 141.3, New York: 133.34, Texas: 93.8, Florida: 109.35. 
(In this context, the index of 100 is the national average cost of living)
# We can see that overall California and New York have a higher cost of living which could impact their income per capita.

# Environmental Factor Two: Poverty Percentage
### What is poverty percentage?
### Poverty percentage is the amount of the population who's income falls below a certain threshold that is considered the "poverty line."

![Average Poverty Percentage Per County](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a78a7b1-af67-4ec7-bc0e-97d6e62e51f1)

### Florida and Texas have on average higher poverty percentage than New York and California, this is expected since those states have a lower income per capita but we see similarites between the states that had a Republican result versus a Democrat result. Regardless, this could be an environmental factor that affects how Latino's voted in the 2020 election.

# Environmental Factor Three: Unemployment
### Unemployment is measured per county by calculating what percentage of the elegible population is unemployed. 

![Average Unemployment per County](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55fe104c-bdab-4fdc-abdc-d05dcbcc9622)

### The blue states, California and New York, have higher percentages of unemployment on average per county compared to the red states, Texas and Florida. Having higher percentages of unemployment can be 

![Income Per Capita vs. Unemployment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2f9270b-f425-40aa-9a7a-a4884620c45c)

### We see that there is a correlation between Income Per Capita and Unemployment, as unemployment increases, the income per capita decreases. This does not align with the data that shows that California and New York have higher Income Per Capitas on average than Texas and Florida yet they also have higher percentages of unemployment than Texas and Florida. A possible reason for this could be due to the fact that although in states like California and New York there is a higher income there could be a bigger percentage of people making very large amount of money that could skew the income per capita. 

# Conclusion 
### Possible factors of how Latino's voted in the 2020 presidential election are, income per capita, poverty, and unemployment. All these factors are very interconnected. Ultimately while there could be significance in the difference of these factors in red and blue states, there are also a lot of different factors that affect how Latino's vote that cannot be represented quantatively, an example of this could be the differing nationalities that are represented as Latinos. There are very many nationalities that are considered Latinos and the cultures and traditions can differ affecting their beliefs. All these states have differing percentages of Latinos from different backgrounds.

### Additionally, it is important to note that a constraint in this research was that the data I used was census data. Census data can be very broad and leaves more details to be desired.
