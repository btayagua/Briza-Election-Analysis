# Briza-Election-Analysis
### My name is Briza Tayagua-Delgado!

# **Research Question**: What environmental factors affect how Latinos voted in the 2020 election?

# I investigated this by looking at four different states with high Latino Populations. These four states are: Texas, California, Florida, and New York.
