### Election-Analysis
# Hello, my name is Briza Tayagua-Delgado!

# **Research Question**: What environmental factors affect how Latinos voted in the 2020 election?

# I investigated this by looking at four different states with high Latino Populations. These four states are: Texas, California, Florida, and New York.

# These four states are the four states with the highest Latino populations in the US.

# We also know that the Latino population makes up a significant portion of the total population because of how it compares to the average populations of white people in each county.

# Latinos made up 11.6% of the voters for the 2020 election, making their impact significant.

Two of these states had a republican result in the 2020 election while the other two had a democrat result in the 2020 election. So, what environmental factors affect how Latinos vote and in turn affect the result of the elections? 

## Environmental Factor One: Income Per Capita
# What is income per capita? 
# Income per capita is a way of measuring the average income per person in a given nation.

# We can see that in Texas and Florida have similar average income's that are lower to the average incomes in New York and California. This could be an environmental factor that affects how Latinos vote in respective states. Although this is possible, it is important to note that this could also be due to the fact that California and New York have higher cost of living than Florida and Texas. 

# According to insure.com/cost-of-living-by-state.html, California had an average cost of living index of 141.3, New York: 133.34, Texas: 93.8, Florida: 109.35. 
(In this context, the index of 100 is the national average cost of living)
# We can see that overall California and New York have a higher cost of living which could impact their income per capita.

## Environmental Factor Two: Poverty Percentage
# What is poverty percentage?
# Poverty percentage is the amount of the population who's income falls below a certain threshold that is considered the "poverty line."

# Florida and Texas have on average higher poverty percentage than New York and California, this is expected since those states have a higher income per capita but we see similarites between the states that had a Republican result versus a Democrat result.
