# **Research Question**: What environmental factors affect how Latinos voted in the 2020 election?

# I investigated this by looking at four different states with high Latino Populations. These four states are: Texas, California, Florida, and New York.

# We also know that the Latino population makes up a significant portion of the total population because of how it compares to the average populations of white people in each county.

Two of these states had a republican result in the 2020 election while the other two had a democrat result in the 2020 election. So, what environmental factors affect how Latinos vote and in turn affect the result of the elections?
